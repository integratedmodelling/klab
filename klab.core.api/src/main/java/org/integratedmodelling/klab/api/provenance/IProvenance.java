/**
 * Provenance in k.LAB is expressed according to the Open Provenance Model
 * (OPM), described in detail at
 * <a href="https://openprovenance.org">https://openprovenance.org</a> and the
 * correspondent W3C documents. The internal representation is more packed than
 * the standard OPM graph, for ease of implementation and use, and can be
 * expanded into it when exporting the graph.
 * <p>
 * All k.LAB objects are mapped to the OPM according to the following
 * conventions:
 * <p>
 * All OPM Entities, including Bundles but not Plans, are
 * {@link IContextualizable}s that <em>produce</em> knowledge or
 * {@link IArtifact} that organize it and make it available for successive
 * steps. Contextualizables that transform knowledge produced by others are
 * activities; the chain always starts at resources and ends at artifacts. The
 * derivation relationships that build the graph have a scale associated; if
 * more than one derivation is present between two entities, they must have
 * different and non-overlapping scales in space, time or both.
 * <p>
 * A model (provided by a contributor or built by k.LAB, such as in learning) is
 * a plan that provides the logical sequence and organizes the
 * contextualizables. An overall plan, the {@link IDataflow}, is built by the
 * resolver and creates the provenance graph as it runs.
 * <p>
 * The observation Activities are organized into super-activities (processes)
 * correspondent to ITask identities in k.LAB. The responsibility for Activities
 * is attributed to Agents, which may be {@link IUserIdentity} or the AI in
 * k.LAB (for attribution of tasks and acknowledgements) or {@link IModel
 * models} for attribution of individual observation activities. Model agents
 * are associated with the correspondent model artifact, which holds further
 * provenance info. In the k.LAB graph the model agent and the model artifact
 * are just coalesced, as IModel contains its statement. In the full OPM graph,
 * the model artifact is the plan that was followed, by the model agent, in
 * executing the computation activity that created other artifacts.
 * <p>
 * The models' sequential execution is driven by a {@link IDataflow}, which is
 * an entity of type Plan, attributed to the AI in k.LAB, an agent representing
 * the {@link IEngineIdentity} that built and ran it. The plan acts within a
 * delegation from a user to the engine. All models run within a dataflow are
 * associated with it. One provenance graph collects all dataflows run to
 * compute all the artifacts within the same root context. The opportunity to
 * include nodes for partners and delegation will be explored later.
 * <p>
 * The artifacts generated by the models are arranged in terms of antecedents
 * and consequents through DerivedBy relationships representing the dependency
 * structure in the model agents.
 * <p>
 * Any {@link IResource}s used by models (data or computations) come with
 * compatible provenance records, which are merged with the provenance graph
 * built during contextualization to produce a full provenance document for an
 * observation context. Implementations can also complement those with details
 * about the hosting nodes and contribution to the k.LAB network as appropriate.
 * <p>
 * Provenance nodes are linked to their k.LAB incarnations through standardized
 * attributes: the provenance graph should not link the k.LAB objects directly.
