/**
 * A Model is a statement that produces a computed observation. It has at least one observable. The
 * k.LAB runtime looks for models when resolving a concept that has been requested to be observed
 * within a context (the root context is always acknowledged through an
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.model.IAcknowledgement}).
 *
 * Models may be unresolved (extensional, i.e. they leave their observable specified only at a
 * semantic level) or resolved (intensional, i.e. they can build their observations as they are and
 * provide observation semantics for it). Models may need to make additional observations, which are
 * specified as pure semantics through {@link #getDependencies() dependencies}.
