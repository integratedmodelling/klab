 * An agent in k.LAB is anything that can make observations. All such agents are a k.LAB
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.auth.IIdentity}. The agent corresponding to a
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.auth.IEngineIdentity} tags choices made by the AI in the
 * system. Observations asserted and made by users using the API will have agents tagged with
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.auth.IUserIdentity}.
 *
 * FIXME agents shouldn't be nodes probably, as they can exist beyond a single provenance graph.
