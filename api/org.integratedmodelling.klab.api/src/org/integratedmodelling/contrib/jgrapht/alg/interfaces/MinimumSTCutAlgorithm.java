/**
 * Given a weighted graph $G(V,E)$ (directed or undirected). This class computes a minimum $s-t$
 * cut. A cut is a partitioning of the vertices into two disjoint sets $S, T $such that $s \in S, t
 * \in T$, and that $S \cup T = V%. The <i>capacity</i> of a cut is defined as the sum of the
 * weights of the edges from $S$ to $T$. In case of a directed graph, only the edges with their tail
 * in $S$ and their head in $T$ are counted. In cased of a undirected graph, all edges with one
 * endpoint in $S$ and one endpoint in $T$ are counted. For a given $s$ and $t$, this class computes
 * two partitions $S$ and $T$ such that the capacity of the cut is minimized. When each edge has
 * equal weight, by definition this class minimizes the number of edges from $S$ to $T$.
 *
 * Note: it is not recommended to use this class to calculate the overall minimum cut in a graph by
 * iteratively invoking this class for all source-sink pairs. This is computationally expensive.
 * Instead, use the StoerWagnerMinimumCut implementation.
